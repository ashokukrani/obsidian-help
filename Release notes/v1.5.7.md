## No longer broken

- Fixed links in properties not getting renamed updated when the file is renamed.
- Fixed Obsidian hanging while scrolling through long files if certain plugins that affect Live Preview are enabled.
- Fixed scroll jumping when typing inside a narrow pane.
- Fixed issue where Canvas would fail to render if a zero-byte image file was embedded on the canvas.
