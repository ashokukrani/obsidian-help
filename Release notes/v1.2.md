<small>Released March 29, 2023</small>

In this update, we revisited some of our older core plugins and provided more than just a fresh coat of paint. Most notably, the Starred plugin is going away in favor of its successor: Bookmarks.

- [Bookmarks](#bookmarks) — Meet the replacement to the Starred plugin.
- [Search UI improvements](#search-ui-improvements) — The Global Search UI has undergone a refresh.
- [Hotkey settings improvements](#hotkey-settings-improvements) — Filter your hotkeys by assigned, unassigned. Even search by hotkey.
- [Misc. improvements](#misc-improvements) — Improvements to the quick switcher as well as new commands for controlling tabs.

## Bookmarks

The Starred core plugin is going away. Introducing: **Bookmarks**.

Bookmark just about anything in Obsidian: files, folders, graphs, searches, headings, blocks. Organize your bookmarks in the much more robust **Bookmark view**. Reorder bookmarks with drag-and-drop. Create _Bookmark Groups_ to organize your bookmarks into collapsible sections.

## Search UI improvements

We've reorganized the Search UI to make things more intuitive and make room for more options. Like being able to bookmark search queries right from here:

## Misc. improvements

- Added new setting called "Always focus new tabs" to **Settings → Editor**. Turn this off to open new tabs in the background.
- Suggest modals now support <kbd>page down</kbd> and <kbd>page up</kbd> as well as <kbd>home</kbd> and <kbd>end</kbd> keys for faster keyboard navigation.
- Links with folder paths will now automatically insert an alias to the base filename (e.g. `[[folder/file]]` will expand to `[[folder/file|file]]`)
- Added "Close tab group" command as well as option to close a tab group from the tab group dropdown menu.

## Bug fixes

- Canvas: Fixed query blocks not rendering in text cards.
- "Export to PDF" will now always export in "light mode."
- Fixed slider tooltip overlapping with cursor.
- macOS: Fixed "Export to PDF" rendering the wrong font.
- Fixed folding arrows being misaligned on list items.
- macOS: double-clicking the sidebar close buttons in the window frame will no longer trigger the window getting fullscreened.
- Fixed "Fold more" command not folding the current line if the cursor is on top of a heading.
