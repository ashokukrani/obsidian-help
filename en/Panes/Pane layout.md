One of the things that makes Obsidian different from other note-taking apps is how easy it is to open multiple files in your preferred configuration.

The window a file gets opened in is what we call a "pane". You can have as many panes as you like.

### Open new panes

#### Open links in [[File explorer]], [[Search]], [[Backlinks]], [[Graph view]], etc.

In general, you can click a link to a file while holding `Ctrl` (on Windows and Linux) or `Cmd` `âŒ˜` (on macOS) to open it in a new pane.

#### Open links in the editor
In the editor, a single click edits the link text rather than following it, `Ctrl/Cmd-Click` is used to follow the link. Therefore, you'll need to hold `Shift` in addition to `Ctrl/Cmd` in order to open the link in a new pane.

#### Split current pane

You can also use the commands "Split vertically" or "Split horizontally" to open two duplicate panes of that file. These commands can be accessed via <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="vertical-three-dots"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M50,6c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12s5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12S56.6,6,50,6z M50,10c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8s-3.6,8-8,8s-8-3.6-8-8 S45.6,10,50,10z M50,38c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12s5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12S56.6,38,50,38z M50,42c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8s-3.6,8-8,8 s-8-3.6-8-8S45.6,42,50,42z M50,70c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12c0,6.6,5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12C62,75.4,56.6,70,50,70z M50,74 c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8c0,4.4-3.6,8-8,8s-8-3.6-8-8C42,77.6,45.6,74,50,74z"></path></svg> More options, the [[Command palette]] or using [[Custom hotkeys|custom hotkeys]].

#### Open linked panes

Some commands such as "Open backlinks" and "Open local graph" will open panes that are linked to the current pane by default. These commands can be accessed via <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="vertical-three-dots"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M50,6c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12s5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12S56.6,6,50,6z M50,10c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8s-3.6,8-8,8s-8-3.6-8-8 S45.6,10,50,10z M50,38c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12s5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12S56.6,38,50,38z M50,42c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8s-3.6,8-8,8 s-8-3.6-8-8S45.6,42,50,42z M50,70c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12c0,6.6,5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12C62,75.4,56.6,70,50,70z M50,74 c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8c0,4.4-3.6,8-8,8s-8-3.6-8-8C42,77.6,45.6,74,50,74z"></path></svg> More options, the [[Command palette]] or using [[Custom hotkeys|custom hotkeys]].

### Rearrange panes

To move a pane, simply drag the document icon <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="document"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M14,4v92h72V29.2l-0.6-0.6l-24-24L60.8,4L14,4z M18,8h40v24h24v60H18L18,8z M62,10.9L79.1,28H62V10.9z"></path></svg> in the title bar. As you drag it around, a visual indicator will show where the pane will be placed.

Drop the pane onto each of the four sides of an existing pane to create a horizontal or vertical split. Or, drop it in the center to swap positions with the target pane.

You can also drag panes into the two sidebars. Panes in the sidebar work a bit differently. Please see [[Sidebars]] for more details.

### Save and load pane layouts

The [[Workspaces]] plugin makes it easy to come back to a particular pane layout. Give it a try!
