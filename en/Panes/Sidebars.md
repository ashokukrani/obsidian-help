### Panes in the sidebar

There are some differences with panes that live in the sidebars.

#### Sidebar panes can share space with tabs

When you drop a pane onto a sidebar pane, a new tab will be created under that sidebar section. Different panes in the same sidebar section can be accessed by clicking on its tab icon.

#### Sidebar panes do not show titles

This reduces clutter, but also means it's best to keep one or two important files like a scratch pad or the daily note for quick access, rather than having a dozen files open.

To see the title of a file that's in the sidebar, hover over its tab icon.

#### Sidebar can be easily collapsed

If there are panes that you only need to look at from time to time, having them in the sidebar makes it really easy to toggle them with a hotkey or command.

#### Toggle editor and preview in sidebar

The hotkey to toggle between editor and preview only works in the main workspace. In the sidebar, you'll need to right click on the tab icon and select "Preview" or "Edit" to toggle between two modes.
