Command palette is a very useful plugin to access nearly all the features of Obsidian without having to remember key strokes. Command palette is **enabled by default**. Type `Ctrl/Cmd+P` to activate, then simply type in the name of the command. If a command has a hotkey, it will appear on the right side.

Custom hotkeys can be added to the Command Palette in Settings -> Hotkeys. [[obsidian-docs/en/Customization/Custom hotkeys#Setting hotkeys|See here]] for more details.

### Usage tips

- To see a list of all commands and shortcuts via the Command Palette, don't type anything into the prompt. The arrow keys will move up and down the list, and `Return` will activate the command. 

- Search in the command palette is fuzzy, so you can type part of the word to get matches. For example, you can use `trm` to search for "Toggle read mode".
