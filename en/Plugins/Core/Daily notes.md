**Daily Notes** allows you to create a new note that is automatically named with the current date. This is a useful way to create a daily log, todo list, or a list of links to notes that you have created on a specific day.  

## How to create a Daily Note
You can create a **Daily Note** either by clicking on the calendar icon <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="calendar-with-checkmark"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M24,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v4H8c-2.1,0-4,1.6-4,3.9v80.5c0,1.1,0.7,2.3,1.5,2.8C6.3,95.8,7.1,96,8,96h84 c0.9,0,1.7-0.2,2.5-0.8c0.8-0.6,1.5-1.7,1.5-2.8V11.9C96,9.8,94.3,8,92.2,8H80V4c0-2.2-1.8-4-4-4h-4c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v4H32V4 c0-2.2-1.8-4-4-4L24,0z M24,4h4v12h-4V4z M72,4h4v12h-4V4z M8,12h12v4c0,2.2,1.8,4,4,4h4c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-4h36v4c0,2.2,1.8,4,4,4 h4c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-4h12v14H8L8,12z M8,30h84v62H8L8,30z M65.4,41.2l-1.1,1.7L48,68.2l-10.7-9.7l-1.5-1.3l-2.7,3l1.5,1.3 l14.2,12.8l18.8-29.2l1.1-1.7L65.4,41.2z"></path></svg> in the left panel, or with the [[Command palette]]. You can also set a hotkey in [[Keyboard shortcuts]]. If a **Daily Note** already exists for the day, it will open that note. 

#### Date format
The date format can be set in ***Settings -> Plugin Options -> Daily notes -> Date format***. The default date format is "YYYY-MM-DD" (ISO format). This format means that a list of daily notes, listed in alphabetical order, will also be in chronological order. 

#### Save location
The save location can be set in ***Settings -> Plugin Options -> Daily notes -> New file location ***.

#### Template file
You can also define a template file for daily notes. This file will be copied into your Daily note when it's created, so it's a good place to put tags or links you use every day. ***Settings -> Plugin Options -> Daily notes -> Template file location ***.
