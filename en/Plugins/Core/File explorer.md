File explorer shows [[Accepted file formats|the list of files Obsidian can recognize]] in your vault.

Here, you can [[Pane layout#Open links in File explorer Search Backlinks Graph view etc|open notes]], [[create notes]] and folders, and [[rename notes]].

Right clicking on a note or directory in the File explorer will bring up other appropriate commands, such as "Copy obsidian url" or "Make a copy". E.g. The "Set as attachment folder" command allows you to set your default folder for when you [[embed files]].

It's one of the crucial plugins that we recommend you to keep enabled.

### Usage tips

1. If the list of files is cluttering the interface though, click the left arrow <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="16" height="16" class="left-arrow"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M70,8c-0.5,0-1,0.2-1.4,0.6l-40,40c-0.8,0.8-0.8,2,0,2.8l40,40c0.5,0.5,1.3,0.7,1.9,0.5c0.7-0.2,1.3-0.7,1.4-1.4 c0.2-0.7,0-1.4-0.5-1.9L32.8,50l38.6-38.6c0.6-0.6,0.8-1.5,0.4-2.2C71.5,8.4,70.8,8,70,8L70,8z"></path></svg> to collapse/hide it:
