Audio recorder is a plugin that lets you make a recording without leaving Obsidian. It's useful for class and meeting notes when you can't catch up for some reason, or for recording important discussions so you don't miss any details.

Note: the first time you try to begin a recording, you may be asked to allow Obsidian access to the microphone.

3. Click on it again to finish recording. By default, the audio file will be saved in your vault and [[Embed files|embedded]] to the end of your current note.

#### Save location
As mentioned above, new audio recordings are saved in your vault by default. However, if you wish to change where they are saved, see [[Manage attachments#Change default attachment location]].
