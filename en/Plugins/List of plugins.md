One of the most powerful aspects of Obsidian is the ability to add new functionality via plugins. It comes with several already, and many more are in development.

You can also build your own Obsidian plugin. See [[Advanced topics/Community plugins]].

Plugins can be managed in *Settings -> Options -> Core plugins*. When enabled, plugin-specific options may become available under *Settings -> Plugin Options*.
