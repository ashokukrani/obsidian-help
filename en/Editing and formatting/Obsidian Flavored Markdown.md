Obsidian strives for maximum capability without breaking any existing formats. As a result, we use a slightly unorthodox combination of flavors of Markdown.

Obsidian mainly uses [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), with some functionality from [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and LaTeX.

In addition, Obsidian adds the following syntax:

Syntax | Description
-|-
`[[ ]]` | [[Internal links]]
`![[ ]]` | [[Embedding files]]
`%%` | [[Basic formatting syntax#Comments\|Comments]]
`> [!note]` | [[Callouts]]

Obsidian doesn't support Markdown syntax or blank lines within HTML blocks.
