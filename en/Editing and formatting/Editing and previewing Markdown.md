Obsidian lets you customize how to edit and preview notes with Markdown syntax using _editor views_ and _editor modes_.

Markdown is a markup language that uses special syntax to format text that's mainly useful when editing your notes. Less so when reading them. Instead, Obsidian can convert them into a format that's more suitable for reading.

Editor views and modes lets you customize how Markdown syntax appears when you're editing and reading notes.

## Editor views

You can switch between the _Editing view_ a _Reading view_, depending on whether you intend to make changes to the note.

To switch between views, select the view switcher (open book icon or pencil icon) in the upper-right corner of the editor, or press `Ctrl+E` (or `Cmd+E` on macOS) in the editor.

You can change the default editor view under **Settings** -> **Editor** -> **Default view for new tabs**.

> [!tip] Side-by-side preview
> To open a note in both editing and reading view side-by-side, press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) and select the view switcher (open book icon or pencil icon) in the upper-right corner of the editor.

## Editor modes

In Editing view, you can edit your notes using one of two modes, _Live Preview_ or _Source mode_.

You can change the default editor mode under **Settings** -> **Editor** -> **Default editing mode**.

### Live Preview

Live Preview is a smart editor mode that previews Markdown-formatted text while you're editing.

Since Live Preview lets you see the formatted in the Editing view, you often don't need to switch between editor views. 

You can reveal the syntax for any Markdown-formatted text by moving the text cursor to it.

### Source mode

Source mode displays the Markdown syntax for the entire note. 

Use Source mode if you prefer to see the plain text representation of the note.
