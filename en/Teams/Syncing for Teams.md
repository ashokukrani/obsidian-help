## Collaboration

With [Obsidian Sync](app://obsidian.md/Introduction%20to%20Obsidian%20Sync) you can collaborate on a shared vault with your team. 

All collaborators **must have an active Sync subscription** to access a shared vault. Joining a shared vault does not count towards your [vault limit](app://obsidian.md/Sync%20limitations#How%20many%20remote%20vaults%20can%20I%20have?).

If the remote vault is [end-to-end encrypted](app://obsidian.md/Obsidian%20Sync/Security%20and%20privacy), collaborators must enter the encryption password when they first access the shared remote vault.
