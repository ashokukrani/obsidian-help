## Collaboration

With [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] you can collaborate on a shared vault with your team. 

All collaborators **must have an active Sync subscription** to access a shared vault. Joining a shared vault does not count towards your [[Plans and storage limits#Plans|remote vault limit]].

If the remote vault is [[Obsidian Sync/Security and privacy#Encryption|end-to-end encrypted]], collaborators must enter the encryption password when they first access the shared remote vault.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I purchase one Sync subscription and use it for my team?**
If you are a team of one person, yes, you can use the Sync subscription for that team member. However, if you have multiple team members, each member will need their own Obsidian Sync subscription to access and share remote vaults.

**Do you have an on-premises Sync server?**
Obsidian Sync does not have an on-premises solution at this time. Feel free to add your use case to [this feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-sync-self-hosted-server/20975) thread.
