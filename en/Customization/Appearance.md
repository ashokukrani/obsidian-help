### Base theme

Obsidian comes with two base themes, light and dark. This option sets the default color scheme your theme uses to either display its light or dark mode version.

### Custom theme

There are lots of community themes contributed by our amazing community that you can easily choose from.

You can easily tweak it by adding [[CSS snippets]].

### Translucency

You can make the window translucent by enabling this option in the settings appearance tab. Currently this option is only available for Windows and macOS.

There's a known issue under Windows where dragging the window is extremely slow when translucency is enabled. This is due to a Windows bug. A GitHub issue tracking the status of a fix can be found here: https://github.com/riverar/sample-win32-acrylicblur/issues/2

### Custom App Icons

Enhance your Obsidian experience with a custom app icon tailored to your preferences. If you're unsure where to begin, explore Obsidian's default icon editor featured on [our blog](https://obsidian.md/blog/new-obsidian-icon/).

Obsidian conveniently accepts `.icns`, `.ico`, `.png`, and `.svg` files, providing flexibility for users to utilize their preferred custom app icon formats.
