Most hotkeys are customizable in Obsidian.

We only defined default hotkeys for the most commonly used commands. If you frequently use a command, it would save you lots of time by adding a hotkey for it.

For a list of default hotkeys, [[Keyboard shortcuts|see here]].

### Viewing hotkeys

The fastest way to see the hotkey set for a command is to find the command in [[Command palette]]. You can use `Ctrl/Cmd+P` to bring it up. If there's a hotkey listed for that command, it's set.

### Setting hotkeys

To add a hotkey, remove a hotkey, or restore hotkeys to default:
1. Go to Settings -> Hotkeys.
2. Click on the `*` icon to the right of each hotkey listed and type whatever key combination you would like.

Note that you can also filter the list, as the list of commands is quite long.
