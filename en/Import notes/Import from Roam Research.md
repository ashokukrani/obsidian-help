3. Unzip the archive into a folder.
4. Open Obsidian. If you already have a vault open, run the **Open another vault** command from the [[Command palette]].
5. [[Manage vaults#Create vault from an existing folder|Create vault from an existing folder]], using the folder where you unzipped the notes.

## Import your Roam Research data into Obsidian

You've created a vault with the exported notes from Roam Research. Unfortunately, Roam Research formats notes differently than Obsidian. To convert the notes to the Obsidian format, use the [[Format converter]].

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Under **Core plugins**, enable **Format converter** and close the Settings window.
3. In the ribbon, on the left side of the app window, select **Open format convert** (ones and zeros icon).
4. Enable the Roam Research formats you want to convert.
5. Select **Start conversion**. This will convert all the notes in your entire vault.
