## Export your data from OneNote

Microsoft offers limited options to export OneNote files. We are currently working on OneNote support via the [[Importer|Importer plugin]].

In the meant you can [Convert OneNote to Markdown](https://github.com/theohbrothers/ConvertOneNote2MarkDown) using a PowerShell script.

## Import your OneNote data into Obsidian

You will need the official Obsidian [[Importer]] plugin, which you can [install here](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-importer).

Depending on the tool you used, the export may be in Markdown format or HTML format. Follow instructions based on the file format you exported to: 

- [[Import HTML files]]
- [[Import Markdown files]]
