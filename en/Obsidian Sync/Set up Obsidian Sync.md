In this guide, you'll enable [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] for your vault.

> [!NOTE] Remote vaults and local vaults
> In this guide, you'll create a new [[Local and remote vaults|remote vault]] and connect it to an existing local vault. You don't need to create a new local vault to use Obsidian Sync.

Once a location is chosen, it is important to note that the data center **cannot** be changed thereafter. To relocate your data, you will need to [Create a new remote vault](app://obsidian.md/index.html#Create%20a%20new%20remote%20vault) specifying the desired hosting location.

## Connect to a remote vault

2. In **Encryption password**, enter the password you configured for the vault.
3. Click **Unlock vault**.
4. Click **Start syncing**.
