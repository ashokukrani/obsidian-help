Obsidian stores your notes in a _local_ vault on your computer or device. If you want to access your notes from other devices, you need to share your local vault with those devices.

[[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] makes this easier by letting you sync your local vault with a _remote_ vault that lives on Obsidian's servers.

You can connect one or more _local vaults_ from your computer or device to your _remote vault_. When you make a change to a local vault, that change is saved to the connected remote vault. The change is then synced across all the local vaults connected to that remote vault.
