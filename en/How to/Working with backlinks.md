Backlinks are one of the most powerful features of Obsidian. As a result, they can sometimes be a bit confusing, so here are some things that might help.

### Backlinks pane
The Backlinks pane has two sections, **Linked mentions** and **Unlinked mentions**.

To open the Backlinks pane, [[Backlinks#How to view Backlinks|see here]].

### Linked mentions
Linked mentions are any links to the current note from other notes.

In the above example, we can see backlinks to three different notes - "**Backlinks**", "**Index**" and "**Linked pane**". These are all notes that mentions the  note via a link. Click on them to follow the link *back* to where the current note was mentioned.

### Unlinked mentions
Unlinked mentions are any mentions to the **name** of the current note (E.g. "**Working with backlinks**") and/or any of its [[Add aliases to notes|aliases]] that were **not** explicitly linked by you using the linking syntax `[[]]`.

This can be a very powerful way of seeing connections between your notes that you did not know you were making when you wrote them. If, for example, you have a note named for a concept that comes up often in your field, you will be able to see easily when it is mentioned in other notes, and thus understand relationships between ideas you might not have otherwise.

Note: Unlinked mentions are **not** case-sensitive meaning "note name", "NOTE NAME" and "noTE nAmE" will all appear as Unlinked mentions for "Note name". 

### Transform Unlinked mentions to Linked mentions
If a reference appears in the Unlinked mentions, and you want to link it, hovering over the text will bring up a **Link** button. Clicking this will automatically surround the highlighted text in the referenced note with brackets, making it into an explicit link and transforming it into a Linked mention.

### Dedicated Backlinks pane
You can also create a separate, dedicated backlinks pane for a note under <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="vertical-three-dots"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M50,6c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12s5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12S56.6,6,50,6z M50,10c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8s-3.6,8-8,8s-8-3.6-8-8 S45.6,10,50,10z M50,38c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12s5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12S56.6,38,50,38z M50,42c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8s-3.6,8-8,8 s-8-3.6-8-8S45.6,42,50,42z M50,70c-6.6,0-12,5.4-12,12c0,6.6,5.4,12,12,12s12-5.4,12-12C62,75.4,56.6,70,50,70z M50,74 c4.4,0,8,3.6,8,8c0,4.4-3.6,8-8,8s-8-3.6-8-8C42,77.6,45.6,74,50,74z"></path></svg> More options. This will be a [[linked pane]] connected to the note, and can be moved around anywhere, as described in [[Pane layout]]. There's also an option to do this in the [[Command palette]].
