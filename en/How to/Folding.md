Folding text is an extremely powerful tool for outlining or writing, in order to focus on what you're working on.

To use folding, go to Settings (the gear icon on the left) => Editor and turn on `Fold indent` and `Fold heading`.

Obsidian has the ability to fold both Markdown headers and indented lists. Note that at the top of this note there is a downward pointing arrow next to the title. If clicked, it folds the entire note up, and if clicked again, it shows the note. This can be applied at multiple levels of Markdown, as well as multiple levels of indentation in lists.

## By way of example

1. Categories of things
   1. A subcategory
   2. Another subcategory
      1. An example of an item
      2. A different, equally important item.
