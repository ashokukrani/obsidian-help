### How auto-update works

Obsidian checks for update every 12 hours. Once an update is available, restarting the app will automatically bring you to the latest version.

You can check your current version, check for updates in Settings => About. You can also turn off "automatic updates" there.

### Insider build

If you're looking to update to the latest insider build, please refer to [[Insider builds#How to enable insider build|this guide]] on how to turn it on.

### Current version vs Installer version

If you look closely in Settings => About, you can find your current version and your installer version.

Your current version is your Obsidian version, i.e. the version of the app running on top of the Electron engine. It increments with auto-updates, but the installer version does not. Your installer version only increments when you (re)install Obsidian with a new installer.

Most features can be delivered by auto-updating, but an updated engine is required for certain new features of Obsidian. We encourage you to grab the latest installer from [our official website](https://obsidian.md) from time to time. Like when there's a huge difference in your current version (e.g. 0.10.8) and the installer version (e.g. 0.8.3).
