In obsidian, a document can be viewed in either **edit mode** or **preview mode**.

### Edit mode
In edit mode, you will see basic markdown rendering, but certain things, like code syntax highlighting and embedded files, will only show up in preview mode. Most notably, any images you embed will only be visible in preview mode.
### Preview mode
In preview mode, code syntax highlighting will be applied,  and you will be able to see and interact with embedded files such as images. You will not be able to edit the note in this mode.

### Commands

#### 1. Toggle edit/preview mode
To toggle between preview and edit mode, click the page/pencil icon in the title bar. In edit mode, it will appear as a page <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="18" height="18" class="lines-of-text"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M16,10c-3.3,0-6,2.7-6,6v68c0,3.3,2.7,6,6,6h68c3.3,0,6-2.7,6-6V16c0-3.3-2.7-6-6-6L16,10z M16,14h68c1.1,0,2,0.9,2,2v68 c0,1.1-0.9,2-2,2H16c-1.1,0-2-0.9-2-2V16C14,14.9,14.9,14,16,14z M22,24v4h52v-4H22z M22,36v4h34v-4L22,36z M22,48v4h52v-4H22z M22,60v4h34v-4H22z M22,72v4h52v-4H22z"></path></svg> ; in preview mode, a pencil <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="17" height="17" class="pencil"><path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M86.3,4c-2.5,0-5,1-6.9,2.9l-1.6,1.6l13.7,13.7c0,0,1.6-1.6,1.6-1.6c3.8-3.8,3.8-10,0-13.8C91.2,5,88.7,4,86.3,4z M74.7,12.1c-0.5,0.1-0.9,0.3-1.2,0.6L8.6,77.6c-0.3,0.2-0.5,0.5-0.6,0.9l-4,15c-0.2,0.7,0,1.4,0.5,1.9s1.2,0.7,1.9,0.5l15-4 c0.3-0.1,0.6-0.3,0.9-0.6l64.9-64.9c0.8-0.8,0.8-2,0-2.8c-0.8-0.8-2-0.8-2.8,0L19.9,88.2l-8.1-8.1l64.6-64.6 c0.6-0.6,0.8-1.5,0.4-2.2c-0.3-0.8-1.1-1.2-1.9-1.2C74.8,12.1,74.7,12.1,74.7,12.1z"></path></svg> .

If you `Cmd/Ctrl` - click, the preview will be opened in a [[linked pane]]. You can also toggle Preview mode by hitting `Cmd/Ctrl - E`, but this hotkey can, of course, be changed. (See [[Custom hotkeys]]).
#### 2. Toggle default view mode
If you want to default to opening in preview rather than edit mode, command "Toggle default view mode" can be found in the [[Command palette]]. To set a hotkey for this command, see [[Custom hotkeys]].
